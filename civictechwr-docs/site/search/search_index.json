This is week 1 of season 1, which puts our cutoff for new projects at July 24, and our Demo Day at Sept 4. If you want to become a CivicTechWR organizer, join the #organizers channel on Slack and check out the project board on Github. There\u2019s lots to do! Discussion and Pitches \u00b6 We had a big discussion about rallying behind a single project vs fostering multiple projects. Outcome so far is to keep exploring and experimenting. Radical Transparency \u00b6 David proposed developing a platform that leverages AI to review and summarize city council meetings. This platform can help people understand what took place in these meetings. It can also be a valuable resource during election time, allowing voters to learn where candidates stand on the issues they care about most. The ability to search within the platform would greatly help people stay informed. This idea can also be adapted to other formats, such as school board meetings.","title":"CivicTech WR Meeting Minutes"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#civictech-wr-meeting-minutes","text":"","title":"CivicTech WR Meeting Minutes"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#date","text":"[2024-06-19]","title":"Date"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#attendees-of-attendees","text":"10","title":"Attendees (# of attendees)"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#agenda","text":"6:00 - 6:20 PM: Welcome + Introductions (Icebreaker: Worst Movie Ever Seen) 6:20 - 6:40 PM: Project Pitches 6:40 - 7:40 PM: Breakout groups 7:40 - 8:00 PM: Progress report and cleanup","title":"Agenda"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#notes","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#sponsors","text":"Venue: Den 1880 Food & Refreshments: Dreamside Digital Software Tools: Foxxwood.com","title":"Sponsors"},{"location":"meeting-minutes/2024-06-19_Meeting_Minutes/#announcements","text":"Headshots by Terry postponed to July 3rd.
