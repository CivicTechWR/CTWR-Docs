### Discussion and Pitches

- We had a big discussion about rallying behind a single project vs fostering multiple projects.
Outcome so far is to keep exploring and experimenting.

#### Radical Transparency
- David proposed developing a platform that leverages AI to review and summarize city council meetings.
- This platform can help people understand what took place in these meetings.
- It can also be a valuable resource during election time, allowing voters to learn where candidates stand on the issues they care about most.
- The ability to search within the platform would greatly help people stay informed.
- This idea can also be adapted to other formats, such as school board meetings.
